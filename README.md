# A2 Genetic Algorithms

# Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming.

Brief summary of what you observed about the "winners" produced by your genetic algorithm. Did changing the parameter values have any effect on what you observed?
Response:
* After manipulating the parameter values, I realized that the higher the round of evolution, the more diverse the best fit values yield. Example, with 10 rounds, the best fit for all rounds might be 2. However, with a 100 rounds, a few generations get up to 4 and even 5!  

Reflection on your experience with this assignment-- what was interesting? what was hard? what do you feel like you learned?
* I absolutely enjoyed this assignment. When I tried to glance through the instructions, it felt slightly challenging. However, I decided to start by taking small steps-- following the instructions one step at a time. I also love the difficulty level of the homework. While the GA_Simulation project is pretty complex, the instructions made them more easy to follow through. I got to refresh basic JAVA syntax memory, as I hadn't worked on a full project in JAVA since CS120.
